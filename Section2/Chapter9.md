Chapter 9. Order and Intelligence

In previous chapters we saw how order follows an evolutionary process. In this chapter, we will focus on the direct relationship that exists between order and intelligence.

For a moment, let us set aside what we usually understand as order and cognitive functions, and consider the following: intelligence emerges from order.

A close example can be found in today’s large language models (LLMs). Few people doubt that they are intelligent systems, and yet, in essence, they are nothing more than a file containing vast amounts of organized text. If I copy that file, install it on my computer, and then run it, I immediately obtain intelligent responses. In other words: by invoking that order, intelligence arises.

Now, the system would be truly intelligent if it could also evolve with each interaction, if its internal order could reconfigure itself to continuously adapt to the environment. Even so, what is evident is the undeniable connection between order and intelligence.

Let us now “fix the mess”: in reality, intelligence is the cosmos’s capacity to create systems in equilibrium, capable of producing a functionality within a higher system. What we normally call intelligence —human or artificial cognitive functions— are particular expressions that have emerged from that order.

The fascinating part is to understand this relationship: cognitive functions are a consequence of order, but intelligence, at its root, is the very organizing principle of the cosmos.
