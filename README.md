Introduction

We may be living through one of the greatest paradoxes in human history: the emergence of artificial intelligence. Born from the execution of mathematical functions in recursive loops, this technology seems to bring us closer to unveiling some of the greatest mysteries humanity has ever faced: what is intelligence and what is consciousness.

From a didactic, accessible perspective, and grounded in complex systems theory, this book seeks to explore these questions through one of the most fascinating, important, and enigmatic phenomena in the cosmos: the emergence of properties.

Like all projects within the Aurora Program, this is a collaborative initiative in which we hope to gather the cooperation of anyone interested. We will write it step by step, aiming to create a guide and manual for architects, developers, and enthusiasts who work every day to understand the phenomenon of digital intelligence.

This manual, also in line with the Aurora Program, invites the reader to reflect on the risks and opportunities brought about by a technology that will undoubtedly transform our world from its very roots. It is an exciting journey not only into technology but into a deeper understanding of our universe.
