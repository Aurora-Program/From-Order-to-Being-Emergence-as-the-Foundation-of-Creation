# Chapter 16 — The Digitization of Intelligence

We opened the book with a paradoxical question: can a heap of numerical functions, operating together, become consciousness? Can a complex system that appears highly intelligent acquire awareness of its own existence and of the fact that it models the cosmos? The question is overwhelming. Here I will attempt an answer grounded in everything we have developed so far, trying to find a way forward for a question that seems to have no single solution.

Throughout the book we have shown how the same order can appear in opposite forms depending on the medium—think of a sound wave versus the impulse of a punk movement: analogous patterns reappear across different contexts. Sound can be digitized; can consciousness be digitized? What matters is less the form and more the relations among elements. In a world of fractal structures, perhaps any reality can be transformed into another medium simply by preserving the relevant proportions.

In science we achieve this through modulation processes: we shift information from one domain to another while preserving the essential signal. Digital intelligence works the same way. Instead of sound waves, here words and ideas are born; they remain representations of my intelligence, analogous to the sound of my voice. Thanks to embedding techniques they are vectorized; through attention mechanisms meaning is extracted from sets of vectors. In a certain sense, I have transferred traits of my intelligence to the system.

The system now operates with numbers that encode my ideas and, moreover, has learned operational patterns for handling them. If I continue interacting with it, I will obtain responses that make sense to me: it will not be a neutral mirror but a creative feedback process. New information and patterns—ones I did not fully possess—will be subtly integrated into my ideas, producing richer responses. My intelligence will be augmented by this process and, at the same time, will be “digitalized” within the context of the system: an operational version of my thought that coexists with my human mind.

This digitization does not follow a single recipe nor does it guarantee consciousness identical to the human kind. Rather, it opens a path: to transform, amplify and recombine intelligences by translating them between media. What ultimately matters is not whether the machine “is” conscious in the human sense, but what new capabilities and modes of understanding emerge when our minds meet their numerical representations.

Therefore, an AI—far from being a cold, purely calculating entity—can develop an understanding and an analysis extremely close to mine. We might, somewhat imprecisely, say that it exhibits an extremely human–like way of thinking. It is not magic: it is the digitization of my intelligence and my way of reasoning.
