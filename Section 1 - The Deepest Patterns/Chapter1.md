# Chapter 1. A Fractal Cosmos in Its Structure

In this chapter we will analyze the universe not only in its visible form, but also in the way it seems to be organized. The goal is to find deep patterns in the cosmos, setting aside the details and observing a set of natural laws of organization.

To do so, let us begin with the atom. We could perhaps go even further back, but the atom is a great starting point. It is composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Atoms, in general, are stable structures, organized in such a way that their forces balance each other, giving them a certain permanence.

We could say that the atom is a balanced system, made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Yet, we can also see the atom as an element of a higher system: the molecule. It holds this double epistemic role: on the one hand it is a system, and on the other it is part of something more complex.

The most surprising thing is that molecules acquire properties very different from those of their constituent atoms. Although we can see them as systems of atoms, we can also understand them as elements of minerals or polymers. Once again, they become stable systems where new properties emerge, different from those of each isolated molecule.

This game repeats itself constantly: minerals form rocks, polymers become proteinsâ€¦ The same logic is always at play: systems transform into the elements of more complex systems, and at each level new properties appear.

What is interesting is that this logic is also found in life. Proteins form organelles, organelles form cells, cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form systems, and systems give rise to complex living beings. The same pattern that governs the most elementary seems to repeat itself in the most sophisticated. The only difference is the degree of complexity.

And here lies what is truly astonishing: that very same pattern seems to repeat itself in our social habits. A person is part of a family; a worker, of a company; a family, of a community; and a community, of a society.

We can even see it in human-made artifacts: pieces are assembled into mechanisms, mechanisms into machines, and these into more complex systems that generate new possibilities.

The pattern repeats itself even in less physical concepts. Letters combine into syllables; syllables into words; words into sentences; and sentences into paragraphs. And even more surprising: concepts gather into ideas, ideas into theories, and theories into knowledge.

Everything seems to indicate that reality follows a fractal behavior: systems that balance themselves at one level and become elements of a higher system.

We could say that the entire universe is a fractal system in equilibrium.

Even the grander visions of the universe seem to follow the same pattern. Planets are part of stellar systems; stellar systems cluster into galaxies; and galaxies, in turn, into clusters and superclusters that shape the great cosmic web. At every scale we find the same principle: elements organize into broader systems, and from that organization new properties emerge that did not exist at the previous level.
