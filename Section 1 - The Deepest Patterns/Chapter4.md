## Chapter 4: A Universe in Constant Motion

The universe should not be understood as a static entity but as a process of continuous evolution. The environment itself is subject to constant transformation, which means that equilibrium can never be truly fixed. Instead, equilibriums are dynamic states that emerge and dissolve as systems adapt to fluctuating conditions.

This principle is observable at every scale. Nothing in the cosmos remains at rest: temperatures fluctuate, celestial bodies move, and living organisms evolve and propagate. Motion is the fundamental condition of the universe. Consequently, the stability of any system cannot rely on rigidity. It must instead be a flexible equilibrium, one that evolves in tandem with its surrounding environment. If order is essential for establishing stability, motion is equally essential for ensuring adaptability and survival.

Systems that are excessively rigid are especially vulnerable to disruption. Even minimal perturbations can cause them to collapse. This is why, in engineering, the most earthquake-resistant structures are designed to be flexible rather than strictly rigid. Similarly, social, ecological, and technological systems that refuse adaptation display an inherent tendency toward decline and eventual failure.

The same principle applies at the subatomic scale. The neutron, apparently a perfect and tension-free system, becomes unstable when isolated. It disintegrates almost immediately, illustrating that an excess of coherence—an inability to accommodate fluctuations—prevents survival within the dynamic fabric of the universe.

In this sense, motion is not merely a property of the cosmos but a prerequisite for existence itself. Persistence and survival are possible only for those systems capable of adapting to, and evolving with, the oscillations of the universe.
