## Chapter 5: Usefulness and Degradation as a Universal Pattern

This may be the most challenging chapter to articulate, the one most likely to provoke controversy and debate. Yet the purpose here is not to persuade, but rather to invite observation of a phenomenon that, while seemingly ordinary, may in fact represent a universal pattern more profound than we usually acknowledge.

Human beings tend to distinguish between two domains of law: natural laws, arising from the very structure of the universe, and human laws, which are perceived as artificial constructs, as if created ex nihilo by society. However, these two domains may not be as disconnected as they appear. Human laws may simply be more complex expressions of the same principles that govern nature.

One potential point of convergence lies in the role of function within equilibrium. In the universe, every element seems to serve a function within a larger balance. When something ceases to contribute to that balance, it effectively becomes waste—energy without purpose—that inevitably degrades and reemerges within a new system of equilibrium.

This principle is evident in everyday life. When a television breaks, its remote control, though fully operational, loses all utility and soon becomes discarded waste. Countless other objects follow this trajectory: typewriters, for instance, largely vanished once printers replaced them, surviving only as museum pieces or decorative artifacts.

The question arises: could this be an intrinsic law of the cosmos? If the universe is a system in continuous change, then each reconfiguration must render certain forms of energy obsolete. That energy, no longer functional, disperses and eventually reintegrates into new configurations.

The evidence surrounds us. A car abandoned and left unused gradually deteriorates: its battery discharges, its tires deflate, its engine corrodes until it becomes little more than oxidized metal. A bicycle follows the same path. Even the human body illustrates this principle: muscles that are not exercised weaken, atrophy, and eventually disappear.

What appears to lose its purpose is not annihilated but transformed. Everything that ceases to serve a role in equilibrium seems destined to degrade, dissolve, and contribute to the emergence of new systems. In this way, loss itself becomes a mechanism of renewal.
