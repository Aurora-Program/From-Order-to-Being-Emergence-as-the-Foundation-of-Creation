Chapter 2. Emergence: The Most Important Phenomenon in the Cosmos

It is striking that a phenomenon so frequent and so fundamental still does not seem to be fully understood by humanity.

From the perspective of complex systems theory, emergence refers to properties that arise within a system as a result of the interaction among its parts.

Let us consider the clearest and simplest example: one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. On their own, these elements are gases at room temperature and behave in completely different ways. Yet when they come together, they form a molecule of water, which acquires entirely new properties: it is no longer a gas but a liquid, with unique characteristics such as fluidity, the ability to dissolve substances, and a vital role in natural cycles. What is most remarkable is that these properties do not exist in the atoms themselves but emerge solely from the way they are organized.

The fascinating aspect of emergence is that the conditions that give rise to a system often seem irrelevant at the next level: what matters is understanding how the system behaves in its emergent state.

At first glance, emergence might appear to be something secondary. But if we look at a more significant case—life itself—we realize its profound importance. Life is a form of emergence. In this case, we are dealing with a more complex system: the cell. Within it, organelles and proteins are arranged in an apparently arbitrary way; yet, at a certain point, these proteins begin to interact, to balance one another, and suddenly—boom!—life appears. Matter acquires the property of persistence and adaptation to its environment. Each interaction is logical and explainable, but taken together, something unexpected arises: a living being.

Moreover, emergence is not limited to biology. It can be found in all systems of the world. Even in human creations we encounter it. Imagine four separate wooden planks: they are just pieces of wood. But if they are joined to form a square, they suddenly acquire new value: they have become a frame. Similarly, when ink is arranged on paper, a drawing emerges; and once it is framed, it becomes a painting.

Emergence also manifests in the abstract: meaning itself is a form of emergence. By arranging a set of words, a complete sense arises. The same happens with pixels on a screen: when organized into colors and shapes, they generate letters, images, and representations.

Once again, we discover a universal pattern: every system in balance generates emergent properties at its higher level.
