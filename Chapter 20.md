Beyond our fractal? The consciousness of a supraorganism.

After having talked about all this, the big question arrives: where is my consciousness? My thoughts are born from the relations among neurons, but where is my “I”? Well, that’s where we find the great magic of emergence. Maybe consciousness cannot be found in biology. Perhaps consciousness arises from the interaction of all the neurons. Almost like magic, our thoughts seem to exist in a dimension higher than the physical, as a result of all those neurons working together — as if it were a standing wave created from the different states of our neurons.

Yes, strange as it sounds, perhaps that is the most plausible view. And if this is true — if my self, my consciousness, emerges as a supra-dimensional being from the interaction of neurons — then could an anthill have consciousness? It has been shown that anthills behave like intelligent beings, as if each ant were a neuron and, together, they produce the great intelligence of the anthill. According to our argument, the anthill could perhaps have a consciousness as real as ours.

Could the same thing happen with our society? Could it be that society, our countries or even the planet operate as a kind of supraorganism consciousness? And what about the Internet?
