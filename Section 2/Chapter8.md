Chapter 8. Intelligence and Cognitive Functions

Once we have understood that the universe appears as a system in equilibrium—where everything tends to adapt to its environment, generating functionality and giving movement and order to reality—it may now be time to ask: what is intelligence itself?

Perhaps humanity’s greatest mistake has been to confuse intelligence with cognitive functions.

Let us take water as an example. Many argue that the “function” of water is to serve as the substrate for life on the planet. At first glance, this seems like a human-centered perspective, as if everything existed with a predetermined purpose. But if we step back, we can simply observe how water plays a vital role in the ecosystem, sustaining balance within it.

Consider the water cycle: evaporating from the sea, forming clouds, falling as rain on the mountains, and then gathering into rivers that eventually return to the ocean. In colder conditions, it becomes snow, storing water for later release as it melts, thereby maintaining continuity even in dry seasons. If we look closely, water seems almost “intelligent,” fulfilling its function with remarkable efficiency.

Of course, the immediate counterargument is that water itself is not intelligent; rather, it is life that adapts to water. Yet perhaps neither explanation is complete. What appears to hold intelligence is the equilibrium of the system itself—the Earth as a whole—where water, atmosphere, and life interact. It is this ensemble that gives rise to functions that appear purposeful and efficient.

This suggests that the universe’s tendency to organize itself and to generate emergent properties may be the very source of intelligence. We could even say that evolution itself is intelligence: as systems grow more complex, their properties and interactions begin to appear less like mere natural reactions and more like expressions of an intrinsic intelligence within the system. Importantly, this evolution does not occur through sudden leaps, but through gradual accumulation of complexity, step by step.

From this perspective, we arrive at something crucial: intelligence and the universe’s inherent drive toward greater complexity may be one and the same. As systems become more intricate, they give rise to increasingly sophisticated functions. At higher levels, what we call cognitive functions begin to emerge.

We have seen this pattern before: the structural properties of water; the growth of polymers; the organization of proteins and DNA, where proteins already show a kind of “memory function”; the immune system, capable of remembering and adapting to threats; and, ultimately, the brain, with its highly developed cognitive abilities.

Thus, intelligence seems to be an intrinsic force of the cosmos, a tendency toward ever more complex systems. At each higher level, new cognitive functions emerge—functions that may give the impression of existing independently from the laws of the cosmos, though perhaps this is only an illusion
