# Chapter 10. Information Through Media

Information can be defined as the set of data that allows us to describe and understand the organization of a system. However, its function is not limited to mere description: information also possesses the capacity to interact with other complex systems, generating dynamic relationships among them.

A central aspect of the universe lies precisely in its ability to transmit energy and information across different media without losing coherence.

Consider the following example: a human thought arises as a series of electrochemical impulses in the brain. These impulses are converted into the coordinated movement of the vocal organs —lungs, vocal cords, tongue, and mouth— which generate specific acoustic pressure waves, that is, sound.

The sound waves reach a microphone, where a filament vibrates in response. This movement activates a magnet, producing magnetic variations that perturb an electric current. The resulting signal is processed by an integrated circuit, digitized, and stored in a memory device.

Later, the process can be reversed: the digital signal is transformed once again into acoustic waves, which reach the ear and are interpreted by another person’s brain. The same information has traveled through multiple media —neurochemical, mechanical, acoustic, electrical, and digital— while consistently maintaining a structural coherence that enables its recognition.

The transmission of information, however, is not restricted to the physical domain. In the social and cultural sphere, analogous patterns also emerge. An illustrative case is the punk movement of the 1980s, characterized by its striking aesthetic, noisy low-fidelity music, coarse language, and disordered gestures. Such cultural expressions, much like waves in a physical system, are associated with states of disorder and rupture.

If a group with these traits enters an orderly space, the interaction tends to produce chaos: shouting, confrontations, the destruction of objects, and the alteration of the environment. The conclusion is not that ideas are inherently linked to disorder, but rather that ideas, when interacting, generate associations that reproduce these patterns.

From this, a broader reflection arises: both excessive disorder and excessive order lead to dysfunctions. The absence of limits results in chaos and violence, while excessive rigidity and dogmatism paralyze evolution, produce unhappiness, and generate dynamics of control. In this sense, dogma, understood as an obsessive function, can give rise to genuine social and cultural aberrations.

The general lesson is that human beings, much like natural phenomena, can be understood as oscillatory systems. Our existence is not defined so much by isolated decisions as by a continuous process of fluctuation between two poles: order and chaos.
